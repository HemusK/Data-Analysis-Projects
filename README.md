Hello, this folder is full of my Data Analysis Projects, I'll be updating it as I come up with new ones.

# WALS project
Technologies used: Python (Sci-kit, Pandas)
You can read a bit more about this in the readme for that file. Basically this was an exploratory project where I implement machine learning clustering methods to categorize language's with common linguistic features. Ultimately I wanted to see if this would have any correspondence with areal groupings, as in if they were in a similar area, or genealogical families, if they shared a common ancestor language. Ultimately it was rather unrelated to either, but I also explain the flaws with my project and how I would fix it.
